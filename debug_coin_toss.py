The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. 
The player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However, the program 
has several bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the 
bugs that keep the program from working correctly.

-Not really sure how to go about this one one
-Thought about starting with some unit tests and assertions
-Settled on the logging module

Ideas for future:
    -Chanage the function to actuall run the game
    -More interactive debugging account
